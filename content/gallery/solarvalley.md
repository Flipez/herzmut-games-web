SolarValley is a strategy game to build up a small village where food is self grown and energy only comes from the sun.

We recommend downloading the game for better performance.

We built in a small halloween easteregg ;)

This is the submitt of Flipez and juljul to the Godot WildJam #38 - SOLARPUNK.
